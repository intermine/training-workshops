### Useful links
#### 🐍 Python

- [Python tutorial](https://github.com/intermine/intermine-ws-python-docs)
- [Python API docs](http://intermine.org/intermine-ws-python/intermine.html)

#### 🇷 R

- [InterMineR on Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/InterMineR.html) - includes links to the reference manual, vignettes, and install instructions.  

### Which InterMine is for me?
- [InterMine Registry](http://registry.intermine.org/) - search for your favourite organism(s). There are tens of InterMines and some InterMines cover a large number of organisms.

### Support:
- There are lots of links on [intermine.org](http://intermine.org) - in particular see the [developers section](http://intermine.org/developers/) for documentation and the [contact](http://intermine.org/contact/) section for support.
